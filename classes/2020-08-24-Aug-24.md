## üõ†Ô∏è Code basics

* Gauge class's comfort levels with basic concepts:
  * Functions
  * Variables
  * Conditionals (if/else)
  * for() loops
  * Arrays
  * Animation
  * Input
  * Objects
  * Classes
* Every language has these - the first goal is to understand these constructs

## üìù Homework:

* Get familiar (or refamiliarize) with basic programming concepts
  * If you have little or no code experience, start [here](https://hello.processing.org)
  * [Welcome to Coding](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/)
    * Go through the 1st section of articles. Even if you're comfortable with the basic concepts, there are lots of important tips within.
    * Get comfortable with:
      * Functions
      * Variables (numbers & booleans for now)
      * Conditionals (if/else)
      * for() loops
      * Arrays
      * Animation
      * Input
  * A video series to reinforce the **Welcome to Coding** articles:
    * [Code! Programming with p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)
      * Please follow along with this series, sections 1-4
* Prepare your tools & workspace
* Prepare to share & document your work
* Build an [ATLAS logo](https://clementzheng.github.io/atlas-wordmark/index.html) "**A**" of your choice with code. Use basic drawing tools to set colors and create shapes:
  * w/Processing:
    * Color
      * [background()](https://processing.org/reference/background_.html)
      * [fill()](https://processing.org/reference/fill_.html)
      * [noFill()](https://processing.org/reference/noFill_.html)
      * [noStroke()](https://processing.org/reference/noStroke_.html)
    * Shapes
      * [Triangles](https://processing.org/reference/triangle_.html)
      * [Rectangles](https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html) and [Quads](https://processing.org/reference/quad_.html)
      * [Ellipses](https://processing.org/reference/ellipse_.html)
      * [Polygons](https://processing.org/reference/beginShape_.html)
      * [Bezier](https://processing.org/reference/bezier_.html) or [Quadratic](https://processing.org/reference/quadraticVertex_.html) curves
  * w/p5js:
    * Color
      * [background()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background)
      * [fill()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill)
      * [noFill()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noFill)
      * [noStroke()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noStroke)
    * Shapes
      * [Triangles](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle)
      * [Rectangles](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect) and [Quads](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quad)
      * [Ellipses](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse)
      * [Polygons](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/vertex)
      * [Bezier](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/bezier) or [Quadratic](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quadraticVertex) curves
* If this is easy for you, try some stretch goals:
  * Add animation or interactivity
  * Get creative with color
  * Make your own "A" designs
  * Build a larger, designed layout with code
