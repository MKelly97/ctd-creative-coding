# Class 2 | August 31

## 📋 Review code

* Go around and show off your ATLAS "A" programs
  * Let's fill in any gaps
* What concepts are you not feeling great about?

## 🛠️ Drawing tools

* The graphics `context`
  * Adjust properties on the context before drawing a shape
    * `fill()`
    * `stroke()`
    * `rotate()`
    * `translate()`
    * `scale()`
  * Set and reset the context
    * `pushMatrix()`
    * `popMatrix()`
  * We've already seen many different ways of drawing a shape (`ellipse()`, `rect()`), but let's consider:
    * `image()`
      * Make sure you load the image with `loadImage()` before drawing
    * `text()`
      * Make sure you load the font first
        * Example in Processing & [p5](https://editor.p5js.org/cacheflowe/sketches/ZbOawrLPw)

## 🛠️ Iteration
  * `for()` loops
  * Nested `for()` loops
    * Grids!

## 🛠️ Animation

* Intro to basic movement and variables

## 📝 Homework:

* Read:
* Watch:
  * [Juice it or lose it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)
    * See how animation effects give a boring game personality
