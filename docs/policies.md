## Code & Course-specific Policies

### Original Works

Modern software development relies on open source code and the benevolent sharing of answers to common problems. The internet has made the act of learning code far more accessible that in decades past. However, with the endless availability of tutorials and example code, where do we draw the lines between original work, using pre-existing code as an ingredient, finding help to get you over a hurdle, and plagiarism?

* Attribution. Processing and p5js are open source tools. Within these ecosystems, there are [libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) and [add-ons](https://p5js.org/libraries/) that expand the abilities of your programming environment. These tools, as a whole, give you superpowers, and you're encouraged to use them. For the purpose of this class - and in a professional sense - it's always best to credit the tools (and their authors) that you've used, whether using them outright or creating a derived piece of work. This is part of being a good open source citizen.

* [Peer instruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Instruction) is highly encouraged and an important part of gaining a deeper understanding of code. Some of us will be better suited to explain programming concepts than others, and every peer of yours will provide a different perspective when working through software problems. Please help each other better understand the class material, and be supportive of each others' current abilities. Code comes far more naturally to some of us than others. Helping someone solve a problem that they don't fully understand yet, but lets them get unstuck and move forward with a larger project, is very much encouraged. We don't always fully understand every line of code that we use, and that's okay.

* Algorithmic originality is a subject of [intense debate](http://mariuswatz.com/mwatztumblrcom/the-algorithm-thought-police.html), largely when it comes to claiming that a well-defined algorithm, left largely alone, is a piece of "art". For the purposes of this class, we're far more concerned cultivating your understanding of the underlying concepts than copying-and-pasting someone else's code (which can itself be a difficult task). The journey towards deeper understanding of the craft is essential in order to grow as a software developer. This is where the line is easily blurred between using pre-existing tools and making original work.


## General CU/ATLAS Policies

### Accommodation for Disabilities

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) under the Students tab on the Disability Services website.

### Classroom Behavior

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.  Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.  For more information, see the policies on [classroom behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/).

### Honor Code

All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu); 303-492-5550). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the [Honor Code Office website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).

### Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation

The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct, intimate partner abuse (including dating or domestic violence), stalking, or protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or cureport@colorado.edu. Information about the OIEC, university policies, [anonymous reporting](https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf), and the campus resources can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).
Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.

### Religious Holidays

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.  In this class, please notify us at least two weeks prior to any conflicts. See the [campus policy regarding religious observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.
